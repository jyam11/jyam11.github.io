<!--Beginning of the Javascript. I created a function called playgame and some
variables. I did not account the first time creating this that people could use
capitalization, and in return the game would not work. I googled and found a
variable I could use called .tolowercase, and this would ignore capitalization
and read any capitalization in the text as lowercase.-->
